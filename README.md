`DON"T FORGET TO ADD YOUR EMAIL AS TESTER EMAIL`
 
video link for  that from second 0:18 to 4:48 -ish ?  just until he download the JSON file and then rename it "credentials.json" and add it to the folder 
`its a mandatory thing to do`
 
2-go and upload your schedule image to [DocSumo website]([url](https://www.docsumo.com/free-tools/extract-tables-from-pdf-images)) 
wait 30 seconds  maybe you need to make a visual glimpse of a checkup 
 
3- run the application  for the first time you gonna get hit with a google sign in page 
`Don't worry ,I have zero knowledge with cyber attacks XD`

after you signed in you the application gonna create for you a pickle file to re-use the application easily without signing in 
 
what is the output of the application ?
 events automatically added to your calendar with a 30 minutes reminder as notification "offline or online "
 and 90 minutes reminder as email "online only " 
feel free to change these values in coed if you want  or maybe i could update it in next version who knows ""D
